            <p>I was born on May 21st, 1992. I've got a Bachelors Degree in Philosophy from Appalachian State University. I'm currently a student at the UNC coding bootcamp. My hobbies include reading, watching movies and documentaries, hiking, fishing, going to music shows and concerts, playing video games and chilling in coffee shops. I'd describe myself as a free spirited, happy-go-lucky, relaxed, and quiet person.I've pretty much lived in Raleigh, North Carolina for most of my life.</p>

          <p>I am always looking for new things to do or try, hence why I decided to take this class. Honestly, I didn't really put too much thought into signing up for this course. I just sorta said to myself "This could be fun. Plus it seems practical to get into and it seems like a good investment." Although coding is kinda frustrating, it's also quite fun. In that regard, it is very much like philosophy to me. I don't really see work as something that brings fulfillment in my life, although I take pride in what I do. I enjoy my life most when I'm not working. I just would like a good job in general, one that gives me enough free time to live out my life comfortably.</p>
